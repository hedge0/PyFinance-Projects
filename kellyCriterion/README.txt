This simple script should size bets for the user, using the formula for kelly criterion to find an optimal % size. The user should input the win probability, the amount of money gained on a win, as well as the amount of money lost on a loss. The script should output the optimal betting size based on the risk / reward ratio that best takes advantage of the law of large numbers (negative number outputs suggest that the bet is a losing proposition in the long term).
